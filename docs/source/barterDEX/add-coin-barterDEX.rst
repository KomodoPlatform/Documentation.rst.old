How to submit a Pull Request to add a coin to BarterDEX
******************************************************* 

First go through :doc:`get-listed-barterDEX` to make sure that all the requirements are satisfied by the coin.

The relavent repository is https://github.com/jl777/coins

This repository is the coins database which is accssed by the graphical applications like the `BarterDEX GUI <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX>`_.

.. note::

    * The filenames in each subdirectory needs to match the coin's symbol exactly, this is the unique field that gets indexed.
    * For icons, please use .png files.

When submitting a pull request to add coin to BarterDEX, make sure you have completed this checklist:

0. The coin must be tested with BarterDEX atomic swaps
======================================================

When submitting your coin addition request, please submit the URLs of the three transctions (``bobdeposit``, ``alicepayment`` and ``bobpayment``) which are produced by the :doc:`atomic swap <trade>` performed by the marketmaker API. This means that before going through the further steps in this doc and submit the data to this coins database `repo <https://github.com/jl777/coins>`_ , you would have performed an atomic swap. The further steps explain the expected files/values to be submitted.

You can learn about performing an atomic swap :doc:`here <install-barterDEX-CLI>` and :doc:`here <trade>`.

Or you can contact the team at coinintegration@komodoplatform.com to get help if required.

Example:
--------

    * bobdeposit: https://btc.example.org/tx/746179890c7cb6b10fe4fef1c835c51a648bba087d52903d9d889d84779b1b9b 
    * alicepayment: https://kmd.example.net/tx/2aa3cdc0000936f8fb2a5285e852a57f128913edea4d562433975fe84f6e6a8c
    * bobpayment: https://btc.example.org/tx/f64ae4b56b43ab9017ccc767c16b9d9cdf438ed83de94ba0629f1213b5ecba72

1. Coin info added to ``coins`` file (Required)
===============================================

You need to add the following info in JSON format to `coins <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins>`_ file:

::

    # Example 1
    {
        "coin": "LTC",
        "name": "litecoin",
        "fname": "Litecoin",
        "rpcport": 9332,
        "pubtype": 48,
        "p2shtype": 5,
        "wiftype": 176,
        "txfee": 100000
    }

    # Example 2
    {
        "coin": "PEW",
        "name": "brofist",
        "fname": "Brofist",
        "confpath": "USERHOME/.brofistcore/brofist.conf"
        "rpcport": 12454,
        "pubtype": 55,
        "p2shtype": 10,
        "wiftype": 198,
        "txfee": 10000
    }

    # Example 3
    {
        "coin": "REP",
        "name": "augur",
        "fname": "Augur",
        "etomic": "0xE94327D07Fc17907b4DB788E5aDf2ed424adDff6",
        "rpcport": 80
    }    

Bitcoin Protocol specific JSON
------------------------------

    * ``"coin"`` must be the coin ticker.

    * ``"name"`` must be coin's name, in all small letters. This is the value which is expected to be default data directory name for that coin. For example if the coin's name is Litecoin then it's expected data directory on Linux is ``~/.litecoin/``, on Mac ``~/Library/Applications Support/Litecoin/``, on Windows ``%AppData%\Litecoin``. Please keep this key's value in small letters only.

    * ``"confpath"`` must be ONLY used in case the expected data directory name of the coin/project is different to the ``"name"``'s value, as explained in last point. Please refer to Example 2 for better understanding. Make sure to use the exact format for ``confpath``. You don't need to change the word ``USERHOME``, it remains as is. Make sure you have a ``/``. after ``USERHOME``. And then the expected coin/project's data directory path and it's expected ``.conf`` file name.

    * ``"fname"`` must be coin's full name.

    * ``"rpcport"`` must be coin's default RPC port. It is expected that it doesn't conflict with any existing coin in the coins db.

    * ``"pubtype"``, ``"p2shtype"``, and ``"wiftype"`` is the also very specific information about coin's parameters. This is specific to Bitcoin Protocol compatible coins only, and such information can be found in source code of the project. These parameters information can be expected in files like ``src/init.cpp``, ``src/base58.h``, and ``src/chainparamsbase.h`` if the project is following the **bitcoin** source code directory/files structure. If the parameters info is unclear then please have these confirmed by that coin/project's developers and make sure it's correct information.

    * ``"txfee"`` is a value of default transactions fee, which must be specified in satoshis. BarterDEX uses this as the default transaction fee value when makes atomic swaps transactions.

Ethereum Protocol specific JSON
-------------------------------

Ethereum protocol specific coin/project add request are the most simplest. ``"coin"``, ``"name"``, and ``"fname"`` information is same as explained in bitcoin protocol specific json section.

``"rpcport"`` must remain default for all ERC20 token/coins. Make sure its only specified as ``80``.

``"etomic"`` must be the ERC20 token/coin's smart contract address.

2. Icon file (Required)
=======================

    * The icon file is required.
    * Icon must be a .png format file.
    * Dimentions of icon file is 82x82 pixels.
    * Icon file name MUST be in **small letters**.
    * Icon file location is `icons <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/icons>`_ directory.

3. Explorer URL (Required)
==========================

    * Explorer file name must be coin's ticker name matching the ``"coin"`` value as specified in `coins <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins>`_ file.
    * Explorer file name must not have any file extension. It is a file without any ``.`` extension.
    * Explorer file name must be all in **capital** letters.
    * It must have a valid JSON array with at least one Explorer URL in it. It's better if there are more than one explorer URLs in this JSON array. Example: ``["http://example1.com/tx/","http://example2.com/tx/"]``.
    * The URL of Explorer must be pointing to the transactions URL. Check BTC file for an example: `explorers/BTC <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/explorers/BTC>`_ , which has ``["https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/"]``. This explorer's URL is used to show in graphical applications to link to the transactions like this `example link <https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/5268d045196e940ca8ba53b442c38a0f8c159002c912f8427239153dce984cc3>`_ . Make sure this URL ends with ``/``. 

4. Electrum Servers (Optional)
==============================

    * Electrum file name must be coin's ticker name matching the ``"coin"`` value as specified in coins file.
    * Electrum file name must not have any file extension. It is a file without any ``.`` extension.
    * Electrum file name must be all in **capital** letters.
    * It must be a valid JSON format as shown in the following example:

                    "email": "electrum2_admin_email@example.com"
                }
