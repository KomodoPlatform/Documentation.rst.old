Don't forget: Coins for trade pairs need to be active in the exchange, either :doc:`native <enable-native-wallet-coins>` or :doc:`electrum <enable-electrum-wallet-coins>` wallets can be used.

LOOKING AT THE ORDERBOOK
========================

To see the order book you need to execute: ``./orderbook``

If the ``./client`` is synced the orderbook will be listed. Remember that you have to add that coin to the orderbook file:

.. code-block:: shell

	nano ./orderbook

add this command with the name of the coin you want to see:

.. code-block:: shell

	curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"NAME_OF_COIN\",\"rel\":\"KMD\"}"

BUYING
======

``./buy`` executes trades based on the values specified in the command. The command looks like this:

.. code-block:: shell

	curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autotrade\",\"base\":\"NAME_OF_BASE_COIN",\"rel\":\"NAME_OF_REL_COIN\",\"relvolume\":VOLUME_OF_REL_COIN,\"price\"PRICE_OF_BASE_COIN}"

You will need to edit this script based on the info the orderbook prints. The script will look for the orders most similar to the values of ``./buy`` and do an atomic swap between the chains.

*After editing the* ``./buy`` *file with your order parameters, execute it and you should have a trade going.*

**IMPORTANT: For better results and security (dust attack vector)** ``./buy`` **only execute trades that are at least 10% of the offered bob(ask) order. For example, if a bob order (an ask in the orderbook) of 10 REVS is offered at a price of 1.25 komodo per REV the autotrade command should be with a relvolume of at least: 1 REV**

.. code-block:: shell

	"{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autotrade\",\"base\":\"REVS\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"relvolume\":1,\"price\":10}"

**since 1 is 10% of the total order of 10 REVS.**

**Alice, the one buying the REVS with KMD, will pay 1/777th of the KMD amount as fee, as a sort of safeguard against spam attacks.**

If you found an order in the orderbook with duration in the command, you should include that in the ``./buy`` method as well:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "userpass": "$userpass",
        "method": "autotrade",
        "duration": 10000,
        "base": "REVS",
        "rel": "KMD",
        "relvolume": 12.5,
        "price": 10
    }
        

SELLING (bob utxos)
===================

``./setprice``

To create a bob utxo (or an ask order) you need to first set the price. To set price you need to edit the ``./setprice`` script in the dexscripts folder:

.. code-block:: shell

	cd ~/KomodoPlatform/iguana/dexscripts/
	nano setprice

This script contains a curl command that looks like this:

.. code-block:: shell

	curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"setprice\",\"base\":\"NAME_OF_COIN_TO_TRADE\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"price\":PRICE_OF_ORDER}"

In this command you should edit the coin (``NAME_OF_COIN_TO_TRADE``) and then set the price (``PRICE_OF_ORDER``) per coin based in Komodo.

For example: if you want to sell REVS at 1.25 komodo per REV, then ``NAME_OF_COIN_TO_TRADE`` should be REVS and ``PRICE_OF_ORDER`` should be 1.25.

**After you edit the file, execute it (** ``./setprice`` **), then it will appear in orderbooks with that coin in either the base or rel.**
