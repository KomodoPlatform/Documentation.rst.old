How to Split UTXO for Notarization
**********************************

Iguana in your Notary Node will be splitting automatically if you have balance in your address and privkey already imported. However, with a lot of coins running inside and notarizing, it may run out of UTXO before auto splitting. It is always good to have manual script to do it when necessary.

Currently you need to have ``0.00010000`` UTXOs for Bitcoin, Komodo, assetchains and ``0.00100000`` for GameCredits (GAME) & Einsteinium (EMC2).

We can just use the following script to do manual UTXO split. The script uses satoshi as amount. Depending your need you can use different amount.

Step 1: Create a script named ``acsplit``
=========================================

.. code-block:: shell

	nano acsplit

Add the following to the ``acsplit`` file and save it.

.. code-block:: shell

	#!/bin/bash
	curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"coin\":\""${1}"\",\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"splitfunds\",\"satoshis\":\"10000\",\"sendflag\":1,\"duplicates\":"${2}"}"

If you want to split UTXO for ``GAME`` & ``EMC2``, you need to change ``\"satoshis\":\"10000\",`` to ``\"satoshis\":\"100000\",``.

Step 2: Give executable permission to ``acsplit``
=================================================

.. code-block:: shell

	chmod +x acsplit

Step 3: Split UTXO
==================

.. code-block:: shell

	./acsplit KMD 50

Important:
==========

	* Make sure you have confirmed balance in your address.
	* Directly mined UTXO will NOT work, you need to shield the mined funds first or send funds from another account or address for splitting.
