Introduction
============

For an introduction to CC in general, see: :ref:`Using the Contracts on a Komodo based Blockchain`

To enable and test contracts:

    * The Blockchain must have the parameter ``-ac_cc`` as described in :ref:`Using the Contracts on a Komodo based Blockchain`
    * The Blockchain must be started using the parameter ``-pubkey`` with a pubkey whose privatekey is owned by only you and imported into the wallet of this particular chain.




A tutorial describing the usage of Channels contract is :doc:`here <scenarios/tutorial>`
