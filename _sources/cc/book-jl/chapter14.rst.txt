Chapter 14 - Runtime Bindings
*****************************

Once build time linking works, then it is one step away from being able to do runtime linking, ie. dynamically linked libraries. There will be some work required to prevent duplication of eval codes and making sure it is a valid version of the CC contract plugin, but these are issues that have been solved before and I dont see any reason they cant be solved for CC contracts.

This would open up the door for quite an interesting ecosystem of CC plugins that blockchains can subscribe to.
