HyperDEX is a truly decentralised cryptocurrency exchange
=========================================================

Built on the Komodo Platform's `BarterDEX <https://barterdex.supernet.org/>`_ network, HyperDEX is entirely peer-to-peer and all trades are made via on-chain atomic swaps. As a result, you are in full custody of your funds the entire time, your private keys never leave your machine.

Caveats
=======

This software is currently in beta
----------------------------------

There is a risk of loss of funds. Only trade in real currency if you can take that risk. We recommend trading the test currencies ``BEER`` and ``PIZZA`` instead. You can get free ``BEER`` at the ``BEER`` `faucet <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet>`_.

HyperDEX is just a GUI
----------------------

HyperDEX is only a GUI layer on top of the ``marketmaker`` daemon which connects to the Komodo Platform's BarterDEX network. ``marketmaker`` is an `independent project <https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/mm.c>`_.

``marketmaker`` is currently in the prototype stage and as a result can be quite buggy and unreliable, which will affect HyperDEX usage.

There are some known ``marketmaker`` issues:

	* Order matching doesn't always succeed.
	* Trades can sometimes get stuck.
	* Poor single threaded performance. (makes the GUI appear laggy)
	* Trades don't always cancel.

	There is a rewrite of ``marketmaker`` in progress which we are expecting to resolve many of these issues.

All marketmaker communication is currently unencrypted
------------------------------------------------------

Currently marketmaker is vulnerable to MITM attacks and your actions and addresses are broadcast in plain text. Do not use HyperDEX on a public network other than for testing.

Encrypted communication is planned for our first stable release.

Most electrum servers are currently ran by community members
------------------------------------------------------------

This means there is an element of trust involved. It's technically possible for a malicious electrum server operator to double spend and therefore reverse swaps.

We are planning to add an option to connect to your own trusted electrum server.

We currently only require 1 confirmation for each transaction
-------------------------------------------------------------

For many currencies 1 confirmation is cost effective to 51% attack. This would allow an attacker to double spend and effectively reverse trades.

We are planning to add an option to specify the number of confirmations your are comfortable with per currency.
