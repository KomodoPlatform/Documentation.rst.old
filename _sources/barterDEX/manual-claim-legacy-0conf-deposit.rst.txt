*****************************************
Manually Claim 0conf Deposits Using Linux
*****************************************

If you are having trouble with claiming your ``0conf`` deposit using the GUI, fear not. The deposits are safe as long as you have your ``passphrase`` and ``txid``. Follow this guide accordingly and you will be able to claim your deposit. This guide will be helpful for both GUI and CLI users for claiming.

Note: Linux is needed to follow this guide and claim deposits using terminal window a.k.a. CLI.

Requirements:

#. Komodo (KMD) running in native mode, blockchain fully synced and passphrase imported - https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/
#. Deposit txid/deposit files
#. Latest barterDEX CLI - :doc:`Instructions </barterDEX/install-barterDEX-CLI>`

Prepare the 0conf deposit files
===============================

For users with deposit files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have the deposit files, you can just use them to claim and don't have to worry about re-creating them from. Just copy them to ``~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/`` dir inside the CLI installation.

CLI
"""

CLI users already should have these files created inside that dir. Just check that you have all the files inside the dir ``~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/``.

GUI
"""

If using GUI, 0conf deposit files can be found inside the BarterDEX data dir called DB which is inside . So, the directory structure is ``.BarterDEX/DB`` in user home directory. This directory is hidden in all OS. In Linux the data dir is ``.BarterDEX`` in user home. In Windows it is ``%appdata%/BarterDEX``.

Inside the DB dir you will find various files which are your 0conf deposit files. Example:

::

	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx  64 Dec 12 13:32 deposits.RANyPgfZZLhSjQB9jrzztSw66zMMYDZuxQ
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx   0 Dec 10 12:56 deposits.RPZVpjptzfZnFZZoLnuSbfLexjtkhe6uvn
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx  69 Dec 10 11:04 instantdex.json
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx 137 Jan  9 11:59 instantdex_RANyPgfZZLhSjQB9jrzztSw66zMMYDZuxQ_append.json
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx  69 Jan  9 11:59 instantdex_RANyPgfZZLhSjQB9jrzztSw66zMMYDZuxQ.json
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx   3 Jan  9 11:58 instantdex_RPZVpjptzfZnFZZoLnuSbfLexjtkhe6uvn_append.json
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 devx devx   3 Jan  9 11:58 instantdex_RPZVpjptzfZnFZZoLnuSbfLexjtkhe6uvn.json

Copy these files inside ``~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/`` dir to be used by the CLI.

Users with txid only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This can be used by all users. You need to put the ``txid`` of the 0conf deposit in an ``instantdex.json`` file inside ``~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/`` dir. The content inside ``instantdex.json`` should look like following:

.. code-block:: shell

	["d5705d948a5a4e0171acec3eb718ca1421ef998b37d0af5c37ac3b440898aef5"]. 

You can use multiple txid usig a ``,`` inbetween the txids. Once you start native KMD and run BarterDEX the deposit files will be created automatically.

Process of claiming
===================

By now you should have all the deposit files ready inside ``~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/`` if you been following this guide without any errors. Now, is the time to claim them.

#. Start KMD in native mode using Agama or ``komodod``, let the blockchain load.
#. Start BarterDEX by issuing ``./client`` script in one terminal and let it running. Output from this terminal is very important for troubleshooting purposes.
#. Open another terminal and use ``./buy`` or any other script as the first API call which will not do anything except showing you coin wallet smartaddress and info.
#. KMD will be activated automatically if you are running native mode.
#. Verify you have the deposits working by issuing ``./balance`` script for KMD smarataddress. It will show you ``zcredits`` and the amount in the output.
#. Use ``./claim`` script. This will claim your 0conf deposit. You may have to wait some time to get back your deposit as this may not be instant.
