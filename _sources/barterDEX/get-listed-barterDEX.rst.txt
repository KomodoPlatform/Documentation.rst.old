Get your Coin/Token/Asset listed on barterDEX
*********************************************

Adding a coin to the BarterDEX is as simple as writing one line of code if your coin is a Bitcoin compatible. Below is a breakdown of the information needed from the source code and coin parameters. The first step is to gather all the information below and contact (User: ``@cipi#4502`` in `Discord <https://komodoplatform.com/discord/>`__) our specialists for review. 

For ETH compatibles go to: :ref:`How to Add new ERC20 Tokens in BarterDEX`

The exact steps to be followed for submitting a Pull Request on Github are described :doc:`here <add-coin-barterDEX>`.

Coin Spec
=========

The Proposed coin must have support for the following API calls and must have BIP65 implemented.

.. code-block:: shell

	estimatefee
	getblock
	getblockhash
	getinfo
	getrawmempool
	getrawtransaction
	gettxout
	importaddress
	importprivkey
	listunspent
	listreceivedbyaddress
	listtransactions
	sendrawtransaction
	signrawtransaction
	validateaddress

Information Required
====================

Example
-------

	* **Coin Ticker** : LTC
	* **Coin Name**: litecoin
	* **rpcport** : 9332
	* **pubtype** : 48
	* **taddr** : 0
	* **p2shtype** : 50
	* **wiftype** : 176
	* **txfee** : 1000000
	* **active** : 1
	
Details to take note of:
------------------------

1. After getting confirmation from our specialists, submit an icon to the ``icons``  directory of the repository: https://github.com/jl777/coins through a Pull Request.

2. BarterDEX uses the info of a coin in the file: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins to perform atomic-swaps. 

3. The explorer repository of the proposed coin contains some of the info required to connect BarterDEX to the coin's own explorer infrastructure.

4. The coin devs will have to send us a small amount of the proposed coin to test the swaps with.

5. Electrum servers are in the electrums-directory. Every coin has its own file there: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums

Json Output Example:
--------------------

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "coin": "LTC",
        "name": "litecoin",
        "active": 1,
        "rpcport": 9332,
        "pubtype": 48,
        "p2shtype": 50,
        "wiftype": 176,
        "txfee": 100000
    }	

Note:
-----

	The key **taddr** , is for zcash forks. It refers to the coin having transparent and zaddresses. The value that has to be passed is the value taken from the file ``src/chainparams.cpp`` from the wallets source code and it is the first value present in both ``base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS]`` and ``base58Prefixes[SCRIPT_ADDRESS]``, but converted to decimal, not the HEX. So if ``base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS]`` = **{0x1C,0xB8}** , the ``taddr`` is 0x1C coverted to decimal: 0x1C in HEX = 28 in decimal. the **"taddr"** : **28**

How to Add new ERC20 Tokens in BarterDEX

	{
	  "coin": "OMG",
	  "name": "omisego",
	  "fname": "OmiseGo",
	  "etomic": "0xd26114cd6EE289AccF82350c8d8487fedB8A0C07",
