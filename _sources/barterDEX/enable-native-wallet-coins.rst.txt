****************************
Enabling Native Wallet Coins
****************************

There are two ways of enabling coins. One method is to edit the ``./enable`` file, the other is to edit the ``./coins`` file. The ``./enable`` file is simple to edit but it will need to be executed manually every time the ``./client`` is executed. On the other hand, the ``./coins`` file is a little more complicated to edit, but a coin that has been activated in the coins file will automatically be activated after ``./client`` is executed.

Editing the ``./enable`` file
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: shell

	cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts
	nano ./enable

Will show:

.. code-block:: shell

	source userpass
	curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"NAME_OF_COIN\"}"

To list a coin on the enable file you need to change NAME_OF_COIN for the coin you want enabled. Copy and paste the line with a new coin for whatever other coins you want enabled. NOTE: KMD is enabled by default and doesn't need to be listed in the enable file.

After changes in the enable file, run:

.. code-block:: shell

	./enable

Editing the ``./coins`` file
----------------------------

Assuming you are in ``~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts``

.. code-block:: shell

	nano ./coins

Will show:

.. code-block:: shell


	export coins="[{\"coin\":\"REVS\",\"active\":1, \"asset\":\"REVS\",\"rpcport\":10196}, {\"coin\":\"JUMBLR\",\"active\":1, \"asset\":\"JUMBLR\",\"rpcport\":15106}, etc, etc, etc}]"

Add ,``\"active\":1``, to any coin you want to be active by default at startup like this:

.. code-block:: shell

	{\"coin\":\"NAME_OF_COIN\",\"active\":1, \"asset\":\"NAME_OF_COIN\",\"rpcport\":10196}

If a coin is PoS, add the following parameter:

.. code-block:: shell

	\"isPos\":1,

You will need to restart the ``./client`` for the coin to get active. This change won't take effect automatically. But once a coin is active, it will activate automatically when you restart ``./client`` without the need to run ``./enable`` first.

**To stop the** ``./client`` **process, use** ``./stop``
