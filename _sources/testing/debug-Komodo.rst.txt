Debug Komodo
************

To run Komodo in debug mode and help developer troubleshoot issues found at client end systems, please follow these steps:

**NOTE:** These steps are including notary node references in komodod command, but in case you are not a notary node, you don't need to include those command parameters.

Prerequisite is to install gdb
==============================

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install gdb

Run Komodo daemon with ``gdb`` tool
===================================

Whichever komodod command you are running which results in crashing or problematic behavior run it with ``gdb -args``

.. code-block:: shell

	gdb -args  ./src/komodod -gen -genproclimit=2 -notary -pubkey="03af2412ebf9517a43d192193490476fd0a44312c70755e07eb03b6d71338ebc9d"

*If you have trouble getting it started, try using the full path to the executable.*

The above command initialize debugging.

Once you see ``gdb>`` command prompt type ``run`` to start komodo in debug mode.

Getting backtrace data
======================

Then when it crashes you'll again see ``gdb>`` prompt, and some message from komodod daemon itself left some output in gdb before ``gdb>``.

Type ``backtrace`` and and it will show further very important info that you need to pass to Komodo developers. Post whatever output you get from ``backtrace`` command to help troubleshoot issues.
