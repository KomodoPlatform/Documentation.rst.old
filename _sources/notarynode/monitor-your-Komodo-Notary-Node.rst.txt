Monitor your Komodo Notary Node
*******************************

When your Komodo Notary Node has been setup, it would be nice to monitor it. Normally I take Zabbix for this, but there is a nicer way then Zabbix. It is called New-Relic. New-Relic is a commercial company, but do offer a free package to monitor your server(s).

So let's grab those until we find a way to monitor the servers in `Discord <https://komodoplatform.com/discord>`_.

Signup with New-Relic
=====================

Go to https://newrelic.com/signup and signup for an account. Verify your email address and log into your account.

Server Setup
============

Now we are going to setup your server for it. Remember, this is based on Ubuntu 14.04, but i don't see any problems with 16.04. If so, let me know.

Login as user into your server. If you have setup your server the right way, you can't login with root anymore. When it asks you for your sudo pass, fill in your password

.. code-block:: shell

	ssh username@server.com

Install repo

.. code-block:: shell

	echo 'deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list

Trust the New Relic GPG key

.. code-block:: shell

	wget -O- https://download.newrelic.com/548C16BF.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Do an update

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get update

Install New Relic

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install newrelic-sysmond

Now go to your New Relic account and go to Account Settings and find there your License key at the right. Right it down somewhere. Now do this

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo nrsysmond-config --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY

And after that we do this

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-sysmond start

Now when you go to the Servers tab in your New-Relic account you will see your server coming in. Give it 30 min to let it synchronise with your server.

Install the New Relic app on your phone and log into it. Now you watch your server all day long without logging in.
