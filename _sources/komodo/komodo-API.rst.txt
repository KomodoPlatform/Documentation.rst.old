Komodo API
**********

You can access this API while ``komodod`` is running. Just go to another terminal and run ``./komodo-cli help``.

For help about a particular API option execute ``./komodo-cli help getwalletinfo``

In some of the explanation of API calls if you find ``Zcash`` consider it replaced by ``Komodo`` and ``zcashaddress`` replaced by ``komodoaddress``
