A Beginner's Guide to starting with the world of Remote UNIX environments and creating Komodo Blockchains
*********************************************************************************************************

The following guide is not comprehensive, but is here to provide a starting point to an enthusiastic learner who has the patience and focus to process new things and look around the web for specific resources regarding unknowns. When 

If you want to test all the latest Komodo features or create your own infrastructure based on our software, first you will need access to an environment in which you'll compile and run the Komodo daemon - ``komodod``.

A common environment used is a VPS (virtual private server) or cloud instance, but you can also use on your PC or bare-metal server.

Stage 0: Rent a VPS
====================

There are various server providers. Some of them: Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS, Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

.. tip::
	
	If you've never used AWS or GCP - they offer a huge free trial which may be a good starting point for your experiments

Recommended servers specifications:
-----------------------------------

	* Hardware requirements vary depending on the type of tasks that you want to perform (Ex: Production system vs just a test srver). 
	* Usually, a configuration like : A CPU with 4 cores, 8 GB RAM, SSD with a capacity >= 100 GB is sufficient. Please note that using a HDD instead of SSD will cause a huge increase in blockchain synchronization times because of the large amount of IOPS (inputs/outputs per second) required.
	* Regarding the operating system, we recommend Ubuntu (version 16.04+) for beginners. It's the most popular Linux distribution and the majority of Komodo's documentation has been tested and written with this Linux distribution in mind. More information on what Linux is can be found here: https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux

Stage 1: Install the OS
=======================

	* The first thing you need is a computer or virtual private server (VPS) with a Linux installation.
	* Setup Ubuntu on local computer or laptop: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop

		OR
	* Setup Ubuntu on VPS: Refer to your VPS provider's documentation for the steps to be followed to achive this. 

Stage 2: Initial OS setup
=========================

	* The very first step after OS installation is to setup some basic access/security configuration. 
	* You can find a basic guide here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04
	* The process of such configuration may be different based on your VPS provider(AWS, GCP) since most of the basic security options are provided from the cloud platform side. But to summarize basic security/access rules:
		1) Don't login as the root user for general use and disable it since it's not a safe practice
		2) Use SSH keys for login instead of a password
		3) Enable firewall to limit all unwanted traffic   

Stage 3: Linux basics
=====================

	* To understand what SSH is, how to configure and use it, etc., the guide below has some examples related to the Digital Ocean platform, but there is a lot of other information that can be accessed through a simple Google search: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-to-connect-to-a-remote-server-in-ubuntu
	* Working with a command line, interactive course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line
	* Some basic information about Linux, it is recommended to carefully read  the section "A Culture of Learning" : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-basics

Stage 4: Compiling the Komodo daemon
====================================

	* If you have followed the guide so far, you have just arrived at the most straight forward and simplest part. Now you should know the basics to accessing and using a remote Linux installation and proceed to compile the Komodo daemon (komodod): :ref:`Installing Komodo on Ubuntu/Debian`
	* To test the Independent blockchains(and their features) that can be spawned using Komodo's technology, you only need to compile the Komodo daemon and there is no need to download Komodo's Blockchain. i.e., only till executing the command ``./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`` in the above guide
	* The following guide has the instructions for creating a new blockchain: :ref:`Creating a new Blockchain using Komodo's technology`  
	* The various parameters using which the new blockchain can be customized are explained here: :ref:`Parameters to customize Blockchains created using Komodo's technology`
