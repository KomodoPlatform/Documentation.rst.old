**********************************************************************************************
Examples and descriptions of various Blockchains that can be created using Komodo's technology 
**********************************************************************************************

The purpose of this document is to give a better understanding of asset chain parameters via examples. These chains are grouped simply by the number of parameters used in customizing each. As new parameters are added, the new combinations will be tested and added here. 

Please see :doc:`create-Komodo-Assetchain` and :doc:`assetchain-params` if you haven't already. 

All chains must have at least ``ac_name`` and ``ac_supply`` set. The ``ac_pubkey`` parameter can be used with any of these chains. If ``ac_perc`` is not set, the only effect ``ac_pubkey`` has  is to have the genesis block be mined to the pubkey that has been specified. The parameters ``ac_name`` , ``ac_supply`` , ``ac_pubkey`` are not counted when grouping based on the ``Number of parameters``.

The values of parameters other than ``ac_name`` in these examples are completely arbitrary. The names of these example-asset-chains are assigned based on how a chain is customized and its grouping.

Number of parameters: 1
***********************

ac_reward
=========

``./komodod -ac_name=1REW -ac_supply=999999 -ac_reward=100000000``

999999 coin premine 

1 coin block reward that does not end.

ac_halving
==========

``./komodod -ac_name=1HALV -ac_supply=999999 -ac_halving=2000``

999999 coin premine 

Default block reward of 0.0001 coin; On demand blocks after block 128

``ac_halving`` has no effect unless ``ac_reward`` is set

ac_decay
========
``./komodod -ac_name=1DECAY -ac_supply=999999 -ac_decay=50000000``

999999 coin premine

Default block reward of 0.0001 coin; On demand blocks after block 128

``ac_decay`` has no effect unless ``ac_reward`` is set

ac_end
======

``./komodod -ac_name=1END -ac_supply=999999 -ac_end=25000``

999999 coin premine

Default block reward of 0.0001 coin; On demand blocks after block 128

Block reward ends at block 25000.


ac_perc ac_pubkey
=================

``./komodod -ac_name=1PERC -ac_supply=999999 -ac_perc=5000000 -ac_pubkey=027dc7b5cfb5efca96674b45e9fda18df069d040b9fd9ff32c35df56005e330392``

If ``ac_perc`` is set, ``ac_reward`` must be set also. This chain does not work at all because ``ac_reward`` is not set.


ac_staked
=========

``./komodod -ac_name=1STAKE -ac_supply=999999 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_staked=90``

999999 coin premine

1 coin block reward

Chain adjusts difficulty so 90% of blocks are proof of stake, 10% proof of work

It’s important to start staking immediately for high percentages of POS. If too many POW blocks are mined consecutively at the start of the chain, the POW difficulty may increase enough to stop the chain entirely, meaning you can’t send a transaction to staking nodes.
